🩺 Disease Detector

📌 Overview

The Disease Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets
Training ML models for disease prediction
Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics
Exporting trained model for reuse
Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
NumPy, Pandas → Data handling
Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms
Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization
Joblib → Model persistence

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease_Detector.git
cd Disease_Detector


Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Open Colab Notebook:

Run the Disease_Detector.ipynb file step by step.

Train the model and generate predictions.

(Optional) Use the saved model (.pkl file) for deployment in other applications.

📊 Example Workflow
Load dataset
Preprocess data
Train ML model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / etc.)
